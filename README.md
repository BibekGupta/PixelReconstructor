# PixelReconstructor
PixelCraft, where pixels become art! This project captures image details through Python magic, storing RGB values and coordinates. It's not just data; it's the key to recreating images with a touch of Python enchantment. Welcome to PixelCraft, where pixels tell a vibrant story! üåàüñºÔ∏è

# Details Explain 

Imagine you have a big piece of paper, and on that paper, you've drawn a picture. This picture is like a magic code that computers understand. Now, this code is made up of many tiny little dots called pixels. Each dot (pixel) has its own color, and together they create the picture.

Now, think of your picture as a grid, like a game board. The top left corner is where we start, and we move to the right and then down, like reading a book. Each time we move to a new square on the grid, we find a pixel there, and that pixel has its own color.

So, when the computer reads your picture, it starts at the top left corner (0,0) and goes to the right and down, checking each square. For each square, it finds the color of the pixel there.

In the code, when we say pixel_values = img_array[y, x], it means we are looking at the pixel in the square at position (x, y) on our grid. The x is like moving left or right, and the y is like moving up or down.

Then, when we say print(f"Pixel at ({x}, {y}): R:{pixel_values[0]}, G:{pixel_values[1]}, B:{pixel_values[2]}"), we are just telling the computer to show us the color of that pixel. The R stands for red, G stands for green, and B stands for blue. These are the primary colors that mix together to create all the other colors.

So, when you run the program, it's like the computer is reading your picture, checking each pixel, and telling you what color it is. Cool, right? And the process_power() part is just the computer telling us how much "brainpower" it's using to do this job and how much time has passed since it started.
